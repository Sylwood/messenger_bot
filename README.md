# messenger_bot
Send mass DMs on Facebook Messenger

Having been in a bunch of clubs during my time in college, I've often found myself in the position of having to individually send the same direct message to a large group of club members at once. For example, if I'm organizing a meeting, I want to check in with everybody who hasn't RSVP'd to the event. `messenger_bot` allows me to do this without having to go through the hassle of multiple copy-and-pastes.
